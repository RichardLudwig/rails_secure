This website is a demo for my secure rails theme. I created this theme to provide new web developers with a secure Ruby on Rails theme they can build on for their own projects.

Fork the GitHub repo to get started.

If you have any recommendations for future features, contact me at https://richardludwig.com

I recommend learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL before using this theme. 

Documentation is on the GitHub Wiki!
