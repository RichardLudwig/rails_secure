This website is a demo for my secure Ruby on Rails blogger starter theme.

Fork the GitHub repo to get started.

If you have any recommendations for future features, contact me at https://richardludwig.com

I recommend learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL before using this theme. 

Documentation is on the GitHub Wiki!
