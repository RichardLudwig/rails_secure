    <p>This website is a demo for my secure rails theme. I created this theme to provide new web developers/bloggers with a secure Ruby on Rails theme they can build on for their own projects.</p>
    
    <p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/RichardLudwig/secure_rails_theme" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> to get started.</p>
