  <h2>Welcome to SecureRailsTheme.com</h2>

  <p>This website is a demo for my secure rails theme. I created this theme to provide new web developers with a secure Ruby on Rails theme they can build on for their own projects.</p>
  
  <p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/RichardLudwig/secure_rails_theme" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> to get started.</p>
  
  <p>If you have any recommendations for future features, contact me at <a href="https://richardludwig.com" target="_blank">https://richardludwig.com</a></p>
